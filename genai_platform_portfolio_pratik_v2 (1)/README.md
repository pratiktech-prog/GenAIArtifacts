This repository contains a curated set of **non‑confidential** artifacts that represent my work as a
**GenAI Platform Lead** for large engineering organizations in regulated environments (e.g., financial services).

It is organized into the following areas:

- `01_prompt_engineering/` – Prompt libraries and Copilot usage patterns  
- `02_architecture_patterns/` – Enterprise GenAI, MCP server, and AI Gateway patterns  
- `03_enablement/` – Onboarding pathways, training curriculum, GenAI guild structure  
- `04_code_examples/` – Python examples illustrating GenAI‑assisted engineering workflows  
- `05_productivity_framework/` – Methods for measuring 1.5x–5x productivity uplift  
- `06_security_and_governance/` – Responsible AI, security controls, governance charter  
- `07_model_evaluation/` – Model evaluation and selection frameworks  
- `08_adoption_dashboard/` – Adoption dashboard and metric definitions  
- `09_maturity_model/` – GenAI capability maturity model for engineering organizations  
- `10_coding_standards/` – GenAI‑aware coding standards for engineering teams  
- `11_case_study/` – Example case study of Copilot rollout and GenAI enablement at scale  
- `12_safety/` – Safety filter concepts and implementation sketch  
- `diagrams/` – Simple SVG diagrams for architecture, developer flow, and routing

All content is high‑level and generic by design—no confidential client data, code, or internal documents
are included. In interviews, I can map these concepts to specific initiatives I have led (e.g., Empath AI,
MiQ Analytics, GitHub Copilot rollout).
