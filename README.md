GenAI Platform Portfolio – By Pratik Gupta Bhaya
This repository showcases a complete, enterprise-grade Generative AI Platform, including architecture, governance, training programs, AWS integration, and hands-on code samples across all layers of a real GenAI system.
It is designed to demonstrate leadership, engineering depth, governance alignment, and enablement experience for roles such as GenAI Platform Lead, AI Architect, Engineering Lead, and AI Governance Owner.

What This Repository Contains
This portfolio includes 6 major layers of an enterprise GenAI platform:
1. Experience / Application Layer (Front-End + UI Integration)
React scripts for AI copilots, chat applications, and enterprise tool integrations. 
Demonstrates how users interact with GenAI through intuitive interfaces. 
2. Model Layer (GPT, Claude, Open-Source + Fine-Tuned LLMs)
Python examples for calling:
OpenAI GPT-4.1 / GPT-4o 
Anthropic Claude 3.5 
Llama / Mistral / fine-tuned models 
Amazon Bedrock-hosted models 
Includes model routing, fallback strategies, and latency optimization. 
3. Orchestration & AI Gateway Layer
Scripts for building:
An internal AI Gateway / MCP Server 
Provider routing logic 
Authentication + request validation 
Multi-model fallback + retry logic 
Mirrors how large enterprises unify GPT, Claude & OSS models under one internal endpoint. 
4. Retrieval & Knowledge Layer (RAG)
Code samples to build:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines 
Vector embeddings 
Chunking strategies 
Domain knowledge grounding 
Includes secure RAG with access control + PII masking. 
5. Analytics & Use Case Layer
